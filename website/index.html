            <h1>Crunchyroll Unblocker</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Download</h2>
            <p>Firefox Users can get the extension <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/crunchy-unblocker/">here</a>.</p>
            <h2>Known Issues</h2>
            <p>Lately Crunchyroll seems to check the session on every page load for logged in users. Sorry, nothing I can do at this point. <b>You can still watch the free stuff with a one week delay without being logged in</b>. If anyone has a solution that does not include using a full time VPN, contact me.</p>
            <h2>Changelog</h2>
            <h3>2.3</h3>
            <p>Good news: unblocking while logged in is back!</p>
            <p>Some of you have hinted me a way but I could not replicate it for some reason. Thanks for telling me, and sorry for not getting this working sooner :)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed login handling</li>
                <li>Added disable button to popup to quickly disable the addon</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.2.3</h3>
            <p>This is just a small update, sorry still no solution for logged in users :(</p>
            <p>But I removed the unblock servers that do not work anymore, this should make switching faster.</p>
            <p>Also, region switching won't happen while logged in. This way you can login/logout depending on the anime you want to watch. Still inconvenient, but better than nothing!</p>
            <h3>2.2.2b</h3>
            <p>Hi everyone! Maintainer from the Firefox extension here.</p>
            <p>Looks like the original creator (who is hosting the unblock server) of this project has no interest in keeping this up. This is why I'm taking over from here on.</p>
            <p>He said in his "farewell" message to just torrent anime. Please do not do that. Support the anime you love to watch, even more in these challenging times. I'll add some servers to the unblocker pool to "fix" the current problems of session IDs getting issued. Please keep in mind, my resources are limited. If anyone wants to help running unblock servers <a href="https://twitter.com/CrUnblocker">get in touch with me</a>.</p>
            <p>Greetings from Germany. Stay safe and healthy!!!</p>
